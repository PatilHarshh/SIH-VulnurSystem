# Vulnerability Monitoring and Notification Tool

This project is a real-time vulnerability monitoring tool designed to keep you updated on the latest security vulnerabilities. It scrapes data from various OEM websites and other sources, processes the information using Generative AI for summarization, and sends email notifications for critical and high-severity vulnerabilities.

## Features

- **Real-Time Data Scraping**: Automatically scrapes vulnerability information from multiple sources, including OEM websites.
- **AI-Powered Summarization**: Uses the latest Generative AI technology to provide concise summaries of vulnerabilities.
- **Email Notifications**: Sends real-time email alerts for critical and high-severity vulnerabilities to keep you informed.
- **Severity Detection**: Classifies vulnerabilities by severity level, allowing you to prioritize responses.
- **Direct Links to Patches**: Provides direct links to patches and mitigation strategies to address vulnerabilities quickly.

## Technical Approach

### Algorithm Development
- Designed to efficiently scrape and process data from diverse formats and sources.
- Implements advanced parsing techniques to handle structured and unstructured data.

### Web Application Development
